This project focuses on developing a **diabetes prediction model using various classification algorithms**, leveraging the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The dataset includes health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes. The project explores models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, among others. The goal is to build a reliable and accurate model for early detection of diabetes, helping in proactive healthcare management. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a detailed comparison of model performance.
